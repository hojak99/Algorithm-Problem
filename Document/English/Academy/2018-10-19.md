I went to english academy for the first time this week. because, I worked overtime.

umm,,,,, there were only two people in the class this time. so, total 3 peple.

One of the topic is "Do you have any friends you have not seen for a long?".

So I think, i have not seen my friend for one years.

because, my friend went to dormitory academy. some times He said, "I want go to medical college". but he hasen't gotten a good score in CSAT. zzzzzzz

so, he will take a exam on next month.

이거 쓰는 것도 힘드네

그리고 다른 이야기도 많이 했다. 클럽 가봤냐랑 인상깊은 여행에 관해서랑 vacation 이 며칠 동안이었냐 등 여러 얘기도 하고 뭐 문제도 풀었는데 `Have + P P` 이런거랑 언제 Are, do 쓰는지 그런거 배웠는데 3년만에 공부하려고 하니까 디질거같다
