## Justin Timberlake - Can't Stop The Feeling ( cover by J.Fla )

i got this feeling inside my bones  
<br>
it goes electric, wavy when i turn it on  
<br>
all through my city, all through my home  
<br>
we're flying up, no celling, when we in our zone  
<br>
i got that sunshine in my pocket  
<br>
got that good song in my feet  
<br>
i feel that hot blood in my body when it drops  
<br>
i can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally 
<br>
you gone like the way we rock it, so don't stop  
<br>
under the lights when everything goes  
<br>
nowhere to high when i'm getting you close
<br>
when we move well you already know  
<br>
so just imagine, just imagine , just imagine ~  
<br>
nothing i can see but you when you dance dance dance  
<br>
felling good good creeping up on you so just dance dance dance  
<br>
come on  
<br>
all those things i should do to you but you dance dance dance  
<br>
and ain't nobody leaving soon so keep dancing  
<br>
i can't stop the feeling  
<br>
so just dance dance dance  
<br>
i can't stop the feeling  
<br>
so just dance dance dance  
<br>
come on  
<br>
ooh~ it's something magical
<br>
it's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
<br>
I don't need no reason, don't need control
<br>
i fly so high, no ceiling, when i'm in my zone
<br>
cause i got that sunshine in my pocket got that good song in my feet
<br>
i feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
<br>
i can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
<br>
you gone like the way we rock it, so don't stop  
<br>
under the lights when everyting goes
<br>
nowhere to hide when i'm getting you close
<br>
when we move well you already know
<br>
so just imagin, just imagin, just imagin
<br>
nothing i can see but you when your dance dance dance
<br>
feeling good good creeping up on you so just dance dance dance 
<br>

<br>
